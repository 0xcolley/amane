# Input

A bar needs buttons: click a workspace to switch to it, scroll over the volume to change it, click the clock to open a calendar.

This page covers mouse, touchpad and keyboard input: clicks, presses, hover, scrolling, dragging, swipes and pinches, the pointer's look, and keys.

## Handling a click

```rust
use amane::{App, Button, LayerWindow, Parent, Rectangle, Text};

fn main() {
    App::new().window(view).run();
}

fn view() -> LayerWindow {
    LayerWindow::new().width(200.0).height(40.0).child(
        Rectangle::new()
            .width(Parent)
            .height(Parent)
            .fill("#1e1e2e")
            .on_click(clicked)
            .child(Text::new("click me")),
    )
}

fn clicked(button: Button) {
    println!("clicked with {button:?}");
}
```

## How input reaches a handler

Input handlers are set on a `Rectangle`. Each frame, Amane remembers where every rectangle with a handler ended up. When you click, it finds the rectangle under the pointer and calls its handler.

If rectangles overlap, the one drawn last gets the event. That's the innermost and topmost one: a button inside a panel gets the click, not the panel.

The handler runs after the frame is gone, so it can't change widgets directly. It changes state instead, usually by writing to a Service, and the view shows the change on the next frame:

```rust,ignore
fn clicked(_: Button) {
    Counter::write().count += 1;
}
```

## Mouse handlers

All of these are methods on `Rectangle`:

| Method | Called | Gets |
|---|---|---|
| `on_click` | when a button is pressed and released over the same rectangle | which `Button`: `Left`, `Right`, or `Middle` |
| `on_press` | as soon as a button goes down on it | the `Button` |
| `on_release` | when the button pressed on it goes up, wherever the pointer is by then | the `Button` |
| `on_hover` | when the pointer comes in, and when it goes out | `true` when it comes in, `false` when it goes out |
| `on_scroll` | for each wheel step or touchpad movement | a `Scroll` |
| `on_move` | on every movement while the pointer is over it | a `Point` |
| `on_drag` | on a left press, and on every movement until release | a `Point` |
| `on_drag_end` | once the left button that started `on_drag` goes up | nothing |
| `on_swipe` | while fingers slide sideways over it on a touchpad | a `Swipe`, see [Touchpad gestures](#touchpad-gestures) |
| `on_pinch` | while fingers spread or close over it on a touchpad | a `Pinch` |

A `Point` has `x` and `y`, measured in pixels from the rectangle's top-left corner. During `on_drag`, the point keeps coming even after the pointer leaves the rectangle, so it can be negative or bigger than the rectangle. Clamp it.

A `Scroll` is measured in lines, so a mouse wheel and a touchpad move things by the same amount. Positive `y` means scrolling down, and positive `x` means scrolling right. It also says what made it:

- `source` is `ScrollSource::Wheel` for a mouse wheel's steps, `Finger` for fingers on a touchpad, or `Continuous` for anything else that moves smoothly, like a trackpoint.
- `stop` is `true` once the fingers lift, usually with `x` and `y` at 0. That's the moment to let something glide on, the way a [Scroll Area](scroll_area.md) does.

## Passing values into handlers

A handler can be a function, like `clicked` above, or a closure. A closure can carry values from the view into the handler:

```rust
use amane::{App, Column, LayerWindow, Parent, Rectangle, Text, Widget};

fn main() {
    App::new().window(view).run();
}

fn view() -> LayerWindow {
    let mut rows: Vec<Box<dyn Widget>> = Vec::new();

    for number in 1..=3 {
        let row = Rectangle::new()
            .width(Parent)
            .height(30.0)
            .on_click(move |_| println!("clicked row {number}"))
            .child(Text::new(format!("row {number}")));

        rows.push(Box::new(row));
    }

    LayerWindow::new().width(200.0).height(90.0).child(Column::new(rows))
}
```

`move` copies `number` into the closure, so each row remembers its own number. `|_|` ignores the `Button` argument.

A closure can't borrow from a Service's `read()`, because the handler lives longer than the view. Copy out what you need first:

```rust,ignore
let id = workspace.id();                                   // a copy, not a borrow
let name = String::from(device.name());                    // an owned copy of the text

Rectangle::new()
    .width(30.0)
    .height(Parent)
    .on_click(move |_| Workspaces::focus(id))
```

## Hover effects

A hover effect needs state, because the view has to know whether the pointer is inside:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

use amane::{App, Color, LayerWindow, Parent, Rectangle, Service};

struct Hover {
    inside: bool,
}

impl Service for Hover {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { inside: false }
    }

    fn interval() -> Duration {
        Duration::from_secs(3600)
    }
}

fn main() {
    App::new().window(view).run();
}

fn view() -> LayerWindow {
    let hover = Hover::read();

    let fill = if hover.inside { Color::from("#45475a") } else { Color::from("#1e1e2e") };

    LayerWindow::new().width(200.0).height(40.0).child(
        Rectangle::new()
            .width(Parent)
            .height(Parent)
            .fill(fill)
            .on_hover(|inside| Hover::write().inside = inside),
    )
}
```

## Pressing down

`on_click` only runs once the button is let go, too late for something that should sink as it's pressed. `on_press` runs as the button goes down, and `on_release` when it comes up again:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

use amane::{App, Center, Full, LayerWindow, Rectangle, Service, Spring, Text};

struct Press {
    scale: Spring,
}

impl Service for Press {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { scale: Spring::snappy(1.0) }
    }

    fn interval() -> Duration {
        Duration::from_secs(3600)
    }
}

fn main() {
    App::new().window(view).run();
}

fn view() -> LayerWindow {
    let scale = Press::read().scale.value();

    LayerWindow::new().width(200.0).height(80.0).child(
        Rectangle::new()
            .width(200.0)
            .height(80.0)
            .align_child(Center, Center)
            .child(
                Rectangle::new()
                    .width(160.0)
                    .height(44.0)
                    .radius(Full)
                    .fill("#89b4fa")
                    .scale(scale)
                    .on_press(|_| Press::write().scale.to(0.94))
                    .on_release(|_| Press::write().scale.to(1.0))
                    .on_click(|_| println!("clicked"))
                    .align_child(Center, Center)
                    .child(Text::new("hold me")),
            ),
    )
}
```

- `on_release` goes to the rectangle that was pressed, even if the pointer has left it, so a held button always comes back up. It also runs if the pointer leaves the window while the button is down, since the window never hears that button go up.
- Pressed on, moved off, and let go is still not a click. `on_click` only runs when the button goes up over the same rectangle.
- A rectangle can have `on_press`, `on_release` and `on_click` together. They run in that order.

## Touchpad gestures

Fingers on a touchpad can do more than scroll. `on_swipe` hears fingers sliding sideways together, and `on_pinch` hears them spreading apart or closing in.

### Swipes

Two fingers moving more across than up or down, over a rectangle with `on_swipe`, swipe it instead of scrolling. This is how two fingers go back a page in a browser on macOS. Two fingers moving up or down still scroll, so a list with `on_scroll` inside a swipeable page keeps working. A swipe of three or more fingers arrives too, if the compositor passes it on. niri keeps three-finger swipes and four-finger vertical swipes for itself.

A `Swipe` has:

- `phase`: `Phase::Began` when the fingers start, `Moved` as they go, `Ended` when they lift, or `Cancelled` if the compositor took them back. Undo what a cancelled swipe did.
- `fingers`: how many fingers.
- `x` and `y`: how far the fingers have moved since they began, in pixels. Positive is right and down, the way the fingers moved, whichever way scrolling goes.
- `speed`: how fast they were moving when they lifted, a `Point` in pixels a second. It's 0 on every phase but `Ended`, and 0 then too if the fingers rested before lifting.

A page that follows the fingers and settles once they lift:

```rust,ignore
fn swiped(swipe: Swipe) {
    let mut pager = Pager::write();
    let resting = pager.page as f32 * WIDTH;

    match swipe.phase {
        // fingers moving left bring in the page on the right
        Phase::Began | Phase::Moved => pager.offset.jump(resting - swipe.x),

        Phase::Ended => {
            if swipe.x < -WIDTH / 2.0 || swipe.speed.x < -300.0 {
                pager.page += 1;
            }

            let target = pager.page as f32 * WIDTH;

            // carries on at the fingers' speed, so it doesn't stall as they lift
            pager.offset.fling(target, -swipe.speed.x);
        }

        Phase::Cancelled => pager.offset.to(resting),
    }
}
```

`offset` is a [`Spring`](animation.md#springs). `jump` keeps it under the fingers and `fling` lets it go at their speed. The full version, with lists that glide inside each page, is `examples/gestures.rs`.

A swipe stays with the rectangle it began over until the fingers lift, wherever the pointer goes.

### Pinches

A `Pinch` has the same `phase` and `fingers`, and:

- `scale`: 1 where it began, 2 once the fingers are twice as far apart, 0.5 at half.
- `rotation`: degrees turned clockwise since it began.
- `x` and `y`: how far the middle of the fingers has moved, in pixels.

Pinches need the compositor to pass them on. niri does.

## Changing the pointer

```rust,ignore
Rectangle::new()
    .width(100.0)
    .height(30.0)
    .cursor(Pointer)
    .on_click(clicked)
```

While the pointer is over the rectangle, it takes that look. The names are values you import from `amane`: `Default`, `Pointer` (a hand), `Text`, `Grab`, `Grabbing`, `Move`, `NotAllowed`, `Wait`, `Crosshair`, and the resize arrows `ResizeTop`, `ResizeBottom`, `ResizeLeft`, `ResizeRight`, `ResizeTopLeft`, `ResizeTopRight`, `ResizeBottomLeft`, `ResizeBottomRight`, `ResizeHorizontal`, and `ResizeVertical`.

`Text` the cursor and `Text` the widget share a name, and both come from `amane`. Rust tells them apart by how they're used. If you'd rather be explicit, write `Cursor::Text`.

A `TextInput` shows the text cursor on its own.

## Transformed rectangles

Input follows a rectangle's transform. A rotated button only reacts inside its rotated shape, not inside the box it took up before rotating ([Rectangle](rectangle.md)).

## Keyboard input

Keys go to a window, not a widget. First the window has to ask for keyboard focus ([Layer Windows](layer_windows.md)), then it handles keys with `on_key`:

```rust
use std::process;

use amane::{App, Key, Keyboard, LayerWindow, Text};

fn main() {
    App::new().window(view).run();
}

fn view() -> LayerWindow {
    LayerWindow::new()
        .width(300.0)
        .height(40.0)
        .keyboard(Keyboard::Exclusive)
        .on_key(key_pressed)
        .child(Text::new("press escape to quit"))
}

fn key_pressed(key: Key) {
    if key == Key::Escape {
        process::exit(0);
    }
}
```

`std::process` is Rust's standard library.

`Key` is one of:

- `Character(char)`: a key that types something, already shifted, like `Character('A')`
- `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Space`
- `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Home`, `End`
- `Control(char)`: a letter or digit pressed with Ctrl held, in lower case, like `Control('v')` for Ctrl+V
- `Other`: any key Amane has no name for yet

### Holding a key

A held key repeats at the rate the compositor sets, usually the one in its keyboard settings. Only keys that make sense again repeat: characters, `Space`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, and the arrows. `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab`, and `Control` keys run once however long they're held, so holding Enter can't submit twice.

### Modifier keys

`amane::modifiers()` says which modifier keys are held right now, for a handler that does something different with Shift or Ctrl:

```rust,ignore
use amane::{Button, modifiers};

fn clicked(_: Button) {
    if modifiers().shift {
        // select everything up to here
    }
}
```

It returns a `Modifiers` with `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, and `logo`, the Super or Windows key. All four are `false` while none of the shell's windows has keyboard focus, since the compositor only tells the focused window.

### When a text input has focus

A focused `TextInput` takes keys before the window does, because typing should type:

- Keys that edit the text, and `Enter`, go to the input only. See [Text Input](text_input.md#keys) for the list.
- `Up`, `Down`, `Tab`, and `Other` skip the input and go to the window's `on_key`. That's how arrow keys can move through a list while you type in a search box.
- Keys the input has no use for, like most `Control` keys, go on to the window's `on_key` too.
- `Escape` takes focus away from the input, and then also goes to the window, which may want to close.

## Terms

- **Handler:** a function Amane calls when an event happens.
- **Target:** the area a rectangle with handlers took up in the last frame.
- **Keyboard focus:** the window the compositor sends keys to.
- **Natural scrolling:** content follows the fingers, so moving them up scrolls down. A `Scroll` is the scroll, and a `Swipe` is the fingers.
- **Fling:** letting go of something while it moves, so it carries on at that speed.
